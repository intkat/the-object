Fuck rights and wrongs. There is no “correct” way of doing things in graphic design.
Liberate yourself from the fear of doing the wrong thing. Stop looking back for approval. 
Instead seek critique, don’t shy away from it. There are a few people who care, and even less who are interested in helping you grow and improve your skills. Appreciate the ones that do.
Humor is the universal key.
Explore things outside of the “standardized” definitions. A book is a “written or printed work consisting of pages glued or sewn together along one side and bound in covers.” Ask yourself, what else can it be?
Find beauty in small things, random things.
Every project is a free fall. You can never fully control your process. Embrace it.
Make it personal.
Turn off your computer. Use your hands.
Whenever you feel like you know enough dig deeper. You never know enough.
Read between the lines. If no one tells you something is banned - do it.
